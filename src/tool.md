# Command Line Interface

The Git Patch Stack command line interface is an extension of Git designed to
make creating & managing your stacks of patches throughout the development and
review lifecycle as easy as possible. It does this by facilitating actions that
make sense within the context of the [Patch Stack
Workflow](./patch-stack-workflow.md) rather than the concepts & operations of
tools like GitHub, Bitbucket, or Gitlab.
