# Command Docs

The Git Patch Stack command line tool has integrated help for the command
itself as well as all of it's subcommands.

You can get a full breakdown of all the commands by running

	gps --help

You can also get detailed help about specific commands by use the `--help`
switch with the command. Example:

	gps request-review --help

## Man Pages

We also provide [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) for the Git
Patch Stack command line tool as well.

The can be accessed as follows:

	man gps-add

*Note:* The man pages are still a work in progress so there may not be the man
page you are looking for. If that is the case, no worries. Just fall back to
using the integrated `--help` switch for the subcommand you are interested in.
